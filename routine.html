							<h1>Routine</h1>

							<p>Goooood moooornniinggg, my love ☀️ The purpose of this routine is to get throughout the day whether we're looking to set up a good daily habit or we're experiencing some discomfort. Our emotions can easily control the way we behave as it's hard to leave the bed, to shower when it's needed, and to eat for body strength. When we’re emotionally sad, we also experience physical pain and it affects our body as a whole. Fortunately, we can do something about this! We may feel fatigue and not have the will to keep on going throughout the day, so what if we listen to a song that reminds us that everything is going to be okay?</p>
                            <h5>Listen to a positive affirming song</h5>
                            <p>One of the songs that I really like to listen is Stronger by Mandisa. It's an upbeat song and has a great message to it. At the same time, it's also a perfect opportunity to praise God. Once we’re done listening to a song, doesn’t it feel easier or a little more relieving to move forward?
                            <h5>Think Optimistically and Say Gratitude</h5>
                            <p>Today is a great day and if you haven’t already gotten out of bed, count to 3 and get up. <i>1, 2, 3.</i> Ready or not, let's get up! As we get out of bed, we'll do some stretches and slowly exhale plus inhale. We can write or tell ourselves gratitude. What are you thankful for? Here are some examples: </p>
							<pre><code>I am grateful for this beautiful day.
I am overflowing with happiness, joy, and gratitude.
I am appreciative for all of the wonderful things this day brings forth.
I am grateful for who I am.
I am thankful for everything that I have.
I am grateful for the opportunities this new day brings me.
I invite gratitude into my heart now.
Every cell in my body vibrates with gratitude.
Today, I will embody an attitude of gratitude.
Thank you for the blessings this day brings.
An attitude of gratitude brings me closer to my desires.
I feel grateful for the abundance of blessings in my life.
I am grateful to be exactly where I am at.
I am grateful for my beautiful life.</code></pre>
                            <p>Once you’re up and have established gratitude, how are you feeling so far? I hope it feels a little more relieving. :- ) </p>
                            <h5>Short Daily Devotions (Two Options)</h5>
                            <p> <b> A) </b> Take 15 minutes to medidate God's words: I use <a href="first15.org">First15</a> and it's got message, scripture, worship, reflection, and prayers! If you don’t feel like going to the website, there’s a podcast in Spotify called, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1KJniz3g6ReqnB624kd0g6">First15 Devotional</a>. <br> <b> B) </b> Use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bible/id282935706">Bible</a> app and start a new plan. It's short and sweet - they've got many plans about hope, healing, anxiety, and such. Most of the plans go on for a whole week and each day takes about at least 5 minutes or so.<br><br> We can do one of them or both. If you ever want to do them together, I’ll be more than happy to do it and grow my faith with you! In the young adult’s sermon, we learned about the importance of memorials and how God’s goodness could give us a push to keep on going forward where we're reminded that he’s there and that he loves us. Optional: create a memorial in our life that reminds us of God’s presence and love for us.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Think about life goals</h5>
                            <p>It encourages us to have a day to look forward to. Think about your future you in a healthier lifestyle! I remember that you wanted to eat healthier and exercise, right? Well, think about how awesome you’ll feel and look!! It’s so exciting when we think about the things we’re going to accomplish. If you think about exercising, put some great songs that keeps your heart rate pumping. Set up reminders or alarms that will remind you to eat. A tip that I have is to establish a morning, healthy routine to look forward to so it can be easier to get out of bed :- ) Write things down or put it in your phone for you to see daily. </p>
                            <h5>Reminders</h5>
                            <p>
                            Remember that there’s no pressure in doing these! It’s important that you do it in your own pace and these steps don’t have to be in order. Whatever helps or is more beneficial to you, use it as an advantage to keep on going! It’s also okay to miss some of the things in your routine, so don’t beat yourself up! It’s okay and we can pull ourselves together once we feel much better, just don’t let it get a hold of you for too long :p <br><br>It’s easy to also be pulled down by things we don’t expect and it can ruin our mood. If that’s the case, we slowly inhale/exhale and remind ourselves that this is temporary. Things are going to get better. We have great days ahead of us. If you don’t see that progress, do not be disheartened. We don’t see it, but God is working in our lives and he’ll never let go of us.<br><br>So let’s keep on praying! Don’t forget to talk to him when you see yourself in trouble or even at peace. ❤️ I love you so much. You’re strong, you’re wonderful, and you’re so worth it ✨</p>
