                            <p>Dear Caitlin, <br> I like you :) <br> I love your compassion and the way you always think about others. I love how your jokes, which are always interrupted by your own laughs, make me smile. <br> You create a safe space for me to express myself because you're always there to listen, and you've been there to support me during some of my most painful days. <br> Thank you for looking out for me, thank you for making memories with me, and thank you for firstly being my friend. <br> Which leads me to my one and only question: <br> My life is so much sweeter with you in it :) <br> - Belle â™¥ </p>
                            
                            <sup>12/04/21</sup>
                            <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WOO!! <br> Here's to another year of you being you! <br> Thank you for being such an inspirational and wonderful person. Your kindness and generosity is unmatched, along with your humor and genuine advice. <br> I'm thankful God has placed you in my life and that he's blessed us with another year with you. I'm rooting for you always, and I'm excited to see where life takes you from here. <br> Love you lots! <br> Belle :)  </p>
                            
                            <sup>12/11/21</sup>
                            <p>Merry Christmas Kye!! <br> May God continue to bless you and your family this season. You are the best gift life could ever give to me â™¥ Like candy canes and Christmas, you and I were "mint" for each other :p <br> Love, <br> Belle </p>
                            
                            <sup>12/20/21</sup>
                            <p><b>It's Midnight and I'm Watching You Drive</b> <br> I am sitting in your Toyota, <br> as the illuminated city passes by. <br> Each light beams into the car, <br> hoping to steal my attention. <br><br> I let my eyes follow their rushing dance, <br> their swift steps that skim your skin, <br> tracing figures up a tender canvas, <br> to end the choreography in your eyes. <br><br> Your hands grip tight to the wheel, <br> yet exude a softness so endearing, <br> only reaching the height of its bliss <br> within my wistful imagination. <br><br> While evoking a melodic question, <br> harmoniously dissolving silence, <br> your sweet notes flush my ears, <br> both soothing and searing them. <br><br> My stomach churns violent waves, <br> stinging walls with every crash, <br> and my heart tumbles and thrashes <br> in an attempt to escape the fever. <br><br> But in the moment your eyes find mine, <br> under gifted glow of red light, <br> there is strange comfort knowing that <br> you are my new beginning. <br><br> I love you, <br> Belle :) </p>
                            
                            <sup>01/20/22</sup>
