                            <p>I would like to take an opportunity to use this special day to tell you how significant you are in my life. I'm not sure where to start from here because the love I have for you is way beyond any words could ever describe. It's almost four months in and I've never felt so secure with anyone until you became part of my life. I'm thankful that you have been so thougtful and supportive with any circumstances I go through. You brighten up my day so quickly that all you ever have to do is smile - even a thought of you smiling gives me so much joy in my heart. In numerous times, I spaced out to relive the memories we had together because it gave me so much dopamine and euphoria.
                            <br><br>
                            I've said this before and I'll say it again: You're one of the biggest blessings in my life. I'm grateful that God has given me you to teach me what love really is - you portray such patience, much understanding, dedicated loyatly, and great selflessness. Last night, you asked me if I ever regret dating you and my answer is... No, I won't and will never ever regret choosing to be with you. You have always been my first choice and in any scenario I'm put in, you will definitely be the first in my list. I would always choose to be with you even if it means that I would have to cancel my plans with someone last minute. It's not the type of person I am, but I could care less what anyone thinks as long as I get any opportunity to be with you.
                            <br><br>
                            Whether it's a virtual or an in person date, I'm always looking forward to making more memories with you. Our relationship may have restrictions and doesn't have the freedom like other couple have, but you are the one and only biggest reason of why I'm here in the first place. I'm willing to go through such lengths and jump hoops to be with you, Hisae. You matter to me and I can't wait until the day where I get to show you off as my wonderful girlfriend to everyone in my life. ♥
                            <br><br>
                            With much love,
                            <br> Hoshi</p>
